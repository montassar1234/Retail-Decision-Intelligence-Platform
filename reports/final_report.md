## Project title

Smart Retail Demand & Decision Intelligence

## Problem statement

Retail organisations usually monitor past sales through descriptive dashboards, but they still struggle to anticipate future demand and quickly react to abnormal sales patterns. This project addresses that gap by combining Business Intelligence and Artificial Intelligence in one decision-support platform.

## Objectives

1. Prepare a clean retail analytics dataset from an open source transaction file.
2. Build KPI tables and business views for revenue, profit, and geographic performance.
3. Forecast short-term demand using machine learning.
4. Detect unusual sales spikes and drops.
5. Segment products into strategic groups.
6. Generate recommendations for business actions.
7. Deliver an interactive dashboard for decision-makers.
